# My first React CRUD app

This is a diary-based app where you can create, read, edit and delete the posts that you make.

I started learning React and JavaScript no more than 3 months ago from uploading this. So this project is to test my _(somewhat little)_ mastery of React, RESTful conventions and everything else JavaScript.

I used the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) library as I'm still not confident in my `CSS` skills yet and that isn't my focus as of now _(but I'll definitely pick it up soon)_.

Code reviews are greatly appreciated!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting the app:

### Step 1:

In the `/posts_api` and `/posts_react` directories, run:

> `npm install` or `yarn`

This installs all the required dependencies for the JSON server and React app.

### Step 2:

In the `/posts_api` directory, you can run:

> `npm start` or `yarn start`

This starts the JSON server in your terminal. Alternatively, you can see it in [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

### Step 3:

In the `/posts_react` directory, you can run:

> `npm start` or `yarn start`

This starts the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
